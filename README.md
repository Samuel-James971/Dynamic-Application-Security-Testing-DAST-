# Dynamic-Application-Security-Testing-DAST-

ðŸ§ª Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Project
Introduction

This repository demonstrates Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using OWASP ZAP against the intentionally vulnerable OWASP Juice Shop web application. The goal of this project is to simulate real-world web application security testing by identifying common vulnerabilities and to document them in a structured report.

The project is designed for educational purposes and showcases the practical application of web security testing techniques, including:

Scanning a live application (black-box testing)

Analyzing and interpreting vulnerability alerts

Generating detailed HTML reports of findings

Organizing evidence and screenshots to communicate security risks effectively

All testing was performed in a safe, controlled environment using a local Docker container. This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand DAST workflows, OWASP ZAP usage, and basic web application security assessment.
