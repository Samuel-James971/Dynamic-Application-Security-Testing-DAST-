# Dynamic-Application-Security-Testing-DAST-

ðŸ§ª Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Project
Introduction

This repository demonstrates Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using OWASP ZAP against the intentionally vulnerable OWASP Juice Shop web application. The goal of this project is to simulate real-world web application security testing by identifying common vulnerabilities and to document them in a structured report.

The project is designed for educational purposes and showcases the practical application of web security testing techniques, including:

Scanning a live application (black-box testing)

Analysing and interpreting vulnerability alerts

Generating detailed HTML reports of findings

Organising evidence and screenshots to communicate security risks effectively

All testing was performed in a safe, controlled environment using a local Docker container. This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand DAST workflows, OWASP ZAP usage, and basic web application security assessment.

# Tutorial 
This screenshot shows the OWASP Juice Shop homepage running locally in a Docker container. The application was started using Docker (docker run -d --name juice-shop -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop) and accessed via http://localhost:3000 in the browser. It represents the target application for the DAST scan.

This image shows the OWASP ZAP graphical interface immediately after launching a new session. ZAP was opened, and a new session was created to prepare for scanning the Juice Shop application.

This screenshot displays the list of vulnerabilities discovered during the automated scan. The scan was initiated from Quick Start â†’ Automated Scan, targeting http://localhost:3000, and the Alerts tab was used to view all identified issues, including their risk levels and affected URLs.

This image shows the detailed view of a specific vulnerability detected by ZAP in the vulnerable JS library, including its description and evidence. A single alert was selected from the Alerts tab, and the Alert Details panel was expanded to capture all relevant information.

This screenshot shows the exported HTML report generated by ZAP summarizing all vulnerabilities found. The report was created via File â†’ Report â†’ Generate HTML Report, and it provides a structured view of risk levels and affected URLs.
